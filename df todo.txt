commit notes:
-added in projectile spawning

======= TODO:

finish watching that brackeys video, there will probably be a lot of useful and well-presented information


PLAYER SCENE
	*can fire off projectiles:	
	-has a link to the UNIT SCENE
	-using any of the attack buttons calls the corresponding move in the unit scene
	
UNIT SCENE
	-add loadout scene child (to manage between multiple loadouts)
	-take damage, consume pw, etc, etc

MOVE SCENE
	holds information about:
	-stats information for the attack
	-projectile information
	-a spawning function that creates projectiles with certain timing

PROJECTILE SCENE
	don't use code to check who the target is, instead put things on physics layers (see brackeys ~30)
	-player, allies, and enemy projectiles share a layer
	-enemies and player/ally projectiles share a layer
	-walls are on both layers

ENEMY SCENE
	*for now, can just be a target dummy. make sure you can hit them with the projectile

ARENA SCENE
	contains a tilemap with obstacles, etc
	when we actually have our tileset made, watch this again and implement it
	*it has all the tools we want, i know because i saw them there
	(see brackeys video section: worldbuilding)



CAMERA SCENE
	It shouldn't just follow the player blindly
	I was looking at baldr sky gameplay to get an idea of this, and it seems like it
	tries to stay between the player and the target, keeping them both in frame
	Let's try to mimic that

ENCOUNTER SCENE
	has information for
	-victory conditions, etc
	-player, allies, enemies and timings, etc
	-a reference to an ARENA scene. By swapping this out, you change the map



REMEMBER
	-on unit defeat, debris
