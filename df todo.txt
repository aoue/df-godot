commit notes:
-created coeff singleton scene to hold all the stat coefficients, allowing for easy balancing tweaks i hope

======= TODO: working on the combat feel 


ENEMY UNIT
	*exists like a target dummy for the player to smack
	-plays its animations
	-can be hit, can be damaged, updates its hp bar

MOVE SCENE
	*has parameters for everything: dmg, break dmg, knockback, cost, pre/exec/post delay and speed mod
	-then each individual move inherits this, but has a unique shape set in its actual scene

DAMAGE AND BREAK
	*add in the break bar
	-take break damage from moves
	-display break on unit somehow?
	-when unit breaks, switch anim to 'stunned' and disable unit for stun delay
	-when unit is broken, show 'Breakdown!' in yellow
	*add in knockback
	-every projectile applies some knockback
	-bodies also get moved by this vector during their physics update

BODY COLLIDERS
	the body colliders could probably be wayy bigger than they are now.
	we dont want the character images to overlap. A nice big circle or capsule shape is fine
	as long as the bullets are moving fast, it's fine

ART
	maybe... maybe i should try pixel art.
	i really like depersonalization's art style...
	but no agh!!! i dont want to use pixel art, man...
	actually, it looks kind of okay :)
	dont judge it before it's in the world with the tilesets



THIS WILL BE DONE WHEN
	the player can hit the enemy unit with a combo of several different attacks

--- beyond the scope of the current task ---

PROJECTILE SCENE
	*once you have ally and enemy:
	-two different layers for projectiles (brackeys vid, ~30m)
	-allies cant hit each other with projectiles
	-enemies cant hit each other with projectiles
	-everyone can hit walls
	this will let you shoot through your teammates
	we also want to make sure that they don't hit and annihilate each other
	bullets of any type should be able to pass through each other with no problem
	*stun and knockback
	-damaging a unit should stun it probably, making them unable to act
	-hitting a unit with a move applies a knockback to them
	

MOVE SCENE
	holds information about:
	-stats information for the attack
	-projectile child (and the collision shape will be set for it here)
	-a spawning function that creates projectiles with certain timing

ARENA SCENE
	contains a tilemap with obstacles, etc
	when we actually have our tileset made, watch this again and implement it
	*it has all the tools we want, i know because i saw them there
	(see brackeys video section: worldbuilding)

CAMERA SCENE
	It shouldn't just follow the player blindly
	I was looking at baldr sky gameplay to get an idea of this, and it seems like it
	tries to stay between the player and the target, keeping them both in frame
	Let's try to mimic that

ENCOUNTER SCENE
	has information for
	-victory conditions, etc
	-player, allies, enemies and timings, etc
	-a reference to an ARENA scene. By swapping this out, you change the map

OBSTACLE SCENE
	when you hit a wall should you bounce off it? i think thats cool
	*has a vector.reflection thing that can help with this
	oh, also the characterbody2d.bounce() function? how nice

REMEMBER
	*on unit defeat, debris
	*heal projectiles (can still work, they should just be like slow-moving floaty bubbles and the idea would be that you have to go run into them. good idea. love ya nai.

AI DESIGN
	the bastion roll has no invincibility frames, neat.
	attacks have a clear tell and buildup before execution
	every attack should have 3 phases:
	-pre delay (also has a speed mod, can be fast or slow)
	-execution (actually doing the attack, has another speed mod, usually very slow)
	-post delay (which can be skipped by starting another attack?, another speed mod too)
	

BUG BACKLOG
	*mouse pointer: in encounter, we used to set the mouse icon to be the red circle
	-this causes the projectile to shoot out misaligned. because the center of the red circle does not line up with the pointer's click location.
