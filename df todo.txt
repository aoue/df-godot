======= TODO: combat feeling

- draw anse unit sprites
	-left/right set
	-up set
	-down set

- create a unit that can move in the four basic directions

- create the ring around the unit that moves with them
	-the anneau system? is it the O.S.? a method to help the FS manage its abilities safely.

- create a projectile that can be created. Simply uses:
	-collision
	-an image (a solid color box is fine for now)
	-an effect when it hits the target (read: damage)

- draw target dummy; two animation cycle is fine

- create a target dummy that can be hit by projectiles
	-no need to worry about hp or anything like that just yet
	-if it just reacts when hit in any way, that's good enough

- draw anse unit sprites
	- melee
	- ranged
	- special

- create one attack of each type:
	-immediate release from the ring in the cursor direction
	-placement on the ring in the cursor direction without firing
	-placement on the ring followed by firing on the next click
	the attacks use the generic projectile class to hit the target dummy

- the unit must be able to use the moves and hit the target dummy

- create a UI mockup. We need to somehow show:
	-player health
	-currently equipped moves and their status
	-enemy health
