commit notes:
-adjusted ai action timer when leaving stun, and stun timing
-adjusted summon type moves to apply speed mod during summon portion as well
-added prep time mechanic, which could be situationally useful for creating certain move behavior (e.g. charging up before doing something)
-fixed bug where hit trading was still occurring

======= NOTES
collision layers/masks notes:
	layer: others can tell when they hit you
	mask: you can tell when you hit others
	- 1: everything related to units moving and hitting world border or obstacles.
	- 9: everything related to RANGED ANTI-ENEMY projectiles hitting units and obstacles.
	- 10: everything related to MELEE ANTI-ENEMY projectiles
	- 17: everything related to ANTI-ALLY projectiles hitting units and obstacles
	- 18: everything related to ANTI-ALLY projectiles hitting units and obstacles
	

======= TODO: combat feeling

immediate notes:
-try adding a pre-delay phase to every move.
-ramp up boost speed over time? current max speed feels undodgeable sometimes.
-little extra speed bump when a boost move hits. this shouldn't happen.

- adelie unit visual overhaul
	- update the spritesheet

- combat effect overhaul:
	- change projectile sprites to match the thick lines of the other art
	- change summon icon to match thick lines too. And make it a circle or something.

- map border collision:
	super unreliable, units often just move right through with no issue. Why's that?
	- because the unit's collider is too small? try increasing it and see what happens.
	- but if it's too big the unit is more likely to get stuck while pathfinding.
	read about this, look up tutorial on how to do it and see if we did it differently.

- ally unit:
	- create one for testing ai target picking (scarecrow is fine at first)
	- also just to make sure that larger scale fights work
	(does ally spread out from player, do enemies target ally and player in a balanced way, etc)

- combat feeling review:
	- it's not enough to just work, it must also feel right.
	we will be able to judge it feels right if we're in a situation where:
	- we have a scene in a pretty encounter map with anse + Friday vs like 4 adelie.
	- also test a scene against a more boss-like enemy. Faster to react, does combos, etc
	do these feel good?
	
	important things:
	- does it feel clean? like you know what's happening? what's going on?
	- moves should have weight behind them. it should feel like: Bang! to bang! to bang!
	each thing you do, you're doing on purpose, and the game clearly reacts to you doing it.

	-more intentional hard hitting combat: make all moves require a setup timer.
	- so you can't just click and use it, they all have a longer prep phase.
	- well we can already do this by shifting the fire times (or using a timer before them, etc.)
	- and then the virtue of comboing would be that you can skip the prep phase of the move?


================

- break vs. hit stun:
	simply, hit stun is what happens every time you land a hit.
	- it's short and sweet and gives you just enough time to get your next move in.
	what is break on the other hand?
	- the idea was that it was something that, by scoring many hits against a target, you would finally do.
	- and that once broken, you could do something extra special to the target.
	however, maybe this is a little bit silly though. it doesn't seem to have a place in game.
	- or idk, maybe it does. Maybe it's just a longer term stun, where you can get in a lot of hits.
	- it's kind of like the 'special move' of the game.
	- oh and also, to actually push a unit into break, you would have to hit them with your break move.
	let's streamline this mechanic.
	- let's turn the break move into a kind of special move.
	the effects of that move could be a longer stun or whatever you want. and the move charged on hits.


- snow effect:
	- when you change direction or come to a stop, pop us a snow effect?

- weather effect:
	- snow or rain particle effects on screen, at varying intensity.

- system to fire projectiles in multiple directions
	of course we want moves that are able to shoot in every direction.
	in addition to the projectile list, there is a projectile offset list
	- for each entry in the projectile list, it fires a projectile at every position in the offset list.
	- entries in the list range from 0-359 are correspond to a position around the unit relative to the position
	  of the unit circle arrow.

- new movement system to consider and test
	ACTUALLY, here's like probably a way better idea:
	- in normal movement mode, wasd like already implemented.
	- instead of shift being a boost, pressing shift would enter into flight mode.
	- when in flight mode, character moves in direction of pointer. faster than normal.
	- probably there would also be a limited duration to it. and also a lockout period too.
	- simple as.
	so you would only want to do this to escape enemies, or close distance fast, or dodge a tricky attack.
	- does it create a situation where you can just shift and run away every time an enemy attacks?
	- maybe, but you still have to get closer yourself too, you know.
	- also, you could still do that in baldr sky, but game still slapped.
	- our method of forcing different weapon sets to be equipped should combat that, right?

- camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time

- create proper loadouts:
	- see paper notes about this

- flow mechanic:
	-some moves generate 'flow'
	-some moves can consume 'flow' to change their effect
	just a little something for players to think about when building a combo, that's it.

- encounter scene expansion:
	a given encounter will be made up of the following:
	- geography: the scene that holds the mat and the obstacles placed on it.
	- army setup: given the geography, this is where all units are placed initially.
	- plot: potential intro and ending cutscene sequences. Kept simple, usually.
	- encounter: rules that dictate how the encounter will play out in terms of combat, like:
		- when to spawn additional enemies/allies (timing, defeated x, etc)
		- unusual victory/defeat conditions (time elapses, ally/boss defeated, etc)
		- scrolling, the route and the speed, if applicable.
		this could end up being complicated, with scrolling, then a room, then more scrolling, etc.
	so create a full encounter scene with all this stuff defined.

- backgrounds and collision (graphical)
	- it would be really cool if objects and background borders had an indicator of where
	  exactly a border is.
	- for example, something like an inobtrusive dotted line around the edges of collision objects.
	bake it into art? seems simplest.
	can then just draw polygons along them.

- red line tracer
	- should we draw a line between mouse position and player to help with aiming?

- remember to create the combat ai in such a way to allow 3-way battles.

- some stuff is broken with multiple enemies here, btw. I think the issue is that they are not being instantiated separately. It's almost certainly this, but make sure before doing any more.
	-pass to encounter manager and have it instantiate them from there
	should fix any issues

- build loadouts properly:
	-see paper notes for movesets. we'll need 2 for anse.

- encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-coordination, so they don't all attack the same target
		-spawning reinforcements, etc

- enemy ai standoff:
	- should this be initialized to a random value in a given range upon combat start?

start of battle animation:
	-if would be cool if there was an animation with all the rings coming on as the fight began

- loadout system:
	- a simple and elegant way to determine which loadout you're switching to next
	rather than just going through them all in a preset order.
	(for the beginning, we only have 2 loadouts so we can ignore it for now.)
	(mousewhell scroll could be a winner for this; or pressing a bound key could also.)
