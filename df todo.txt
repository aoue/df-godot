commit notes:
-added camera script w/ limits

======= NOTES
collision layers/masks notes:
	layer: gets hit
	mask: hits others
	- 1: everything related to units moving and hitting world border or obstacles. (all units)
	- 2: enemy unit physical collision layer (all enemies)
	- 3: ally unit physical collision layer (all allies, NOT player)
	- 9: everything related to RANGED ANTI-ENEMY projectiles hitting units and obstacles.
	- 10: everything related to MELEE ANTI-ENEMY projectiles
	- 17: everything related to ANTI-ALLY projectiles hitting units and obstacles
	- 18: everything related to ANTI-ALLY projectiles hitting units and obstacles

======= THE BIG DEAL: 

What is this game's thing? Here is what it is:
	- the preset sequences of moves of the loadout system.
	- the on the fly selection of loadouts as you go. A mix of preparation and improvisation.
	- swapping target mid-combo, that feeling of like weaving through a horde of enemies, fighting them all but making it through, stopping them as they launch themselves at you.
	(you can select this by pressing a number key at any time while the loadout is active/swapping)
	so you can decide how you want to continue the combo in the moment.

- rest of Friday unit sprite sheet:
	- being hit
	- melee
	- ranged
	- special (what is this? 'forms', but what is that? kicking maybe?)

- new visual style test:
	- change code that determines unit direction to match as well.

- camera lock tech:
	- make it so camera doesn't show out of bounds
	- params set by the bg's dimensions
	- cmaera view should be a combo between player body and mouse positions? 

- generalize ai unit scene:
	current adelie scene into the standard 'ai unit' scene

- add create new units from ai unit scene:
	- sharp beaked adelie
	- wired Adelie

- notes for iterating on art:
	(see new refs folder featuring the work of the amazing [frider])
	overall darker and more muted visual style.
	- new background too
	- look at sketchbook drawings 
	- see if we can go for a more serious style (remember people are going to die)
	- a lot of it is colours and moody lighting
	you can use Friday as the case study? or maybe anse, idk
	
	- consider increasing sprite size to like 1200x or 1500x to allow for more detailed drawings.
	- and place emphasis on backpacks/engines and hip jets. bulkier, like old infantry designs.
	- named characters should have hair poking through and unique/strong/distinctive designs.

- visual overhaul:
	- the spritesheet for anse will need to be redone at some point. 
	Probably by adding his hair and changing colours to the brown/tan of his coat.
	- maybe could do something like tall lined collar but no hood; go back to big collared anse.
	(symbolic, etc, after all.)
	Here's a general idea. For generic FSes, they can wear full hoods.
	But for important characters, they should have their hair visible somewhere.

- test battles:
	- anse vs 2/3/4 adelie
	- anse + friendly vs 2/3/4 adelie
	check the feeling...
	honestly i can't tell right now. There's some good stuff, some bad stuff.
	it clearly feels incomplete right now. Part is mechanics, part is how it looks.
	i definitely think some issues are:
	- combos are not especially satisfying to pull off. No mechanical challenge.
	- battle is very chaotic. slowing it down a little might be beneficial.
	- it doesn't look cool. sound, better art, effects, will do a lot for this.

- lights and shadows
	- see documentation page

=== [visual overhaul gate] ===

- individual ai unit behaviour?
	- create a different behaviour for ai units from scratch?
	still keep this in mind. Could make a lot of sense.

- retreat destination and pathing still needs work:
	- lots of time units bump against walls
	- change possible angle? or give bias towards the center?
	- or: if near edge of map, then select retreat spot differently

- stricter ai patterns?:
	- when a guy gets hit, immediately force swap into retreat intention (doing this)
	- cannot get the same intention twice in a row (could try doing this)
		- could force units into sleep more, so they don't just stand there.
	- if start in standoff, then sleep intention instead for the wander

- Friday unit:
	- object
	- spritesheet
	- moveset

- another combo mechanic (low priority):
	- a single loadout can only be used a single time in a combo
	- you can't loop back around to the same loadout twice in one go

- combat feeling review:
	- it's not enough to just work, it must also feel right.
	we will be able to judge it feels right if we're in a situation where:
	- we have a scene in a pretty encounter map with anse + Friday vs like 4 adelie.
	- also test a scene against a more boss-like enemy. Faster to react, does combos, etc
	do these feel good?
	
	important things:
	- does it feel slick? like you know what's happening? what's going on?
	- moves should have weight behind them. it should feel like: Bang! to bang! to bang!
	each thing you do, you're doing on purpose, and the game clearly reacts to you doing it.

sound overhaul:
	lots of things need sound:
	- units moving
	- environment (wind, snow, rain, creaking, etc)
	- unit using a move
	- unit being hit by a move
	- music

- combo routing factors:
	in baldr sky, move order is quite technical because of launching and knockdown
	- our system doesn't have either of these things.
	what limits do we have in terms of which moves you can connect together?
	- move output cost: which will determine the length of your combo, and also last move, which is free.
	- range of the move: mixing close and far ranges can be tricky.
	- knockback: a big knockback move will knock an enemy out of range of a short move.
	- future 'flow': some moves do damage relative to flow generated, and may consume it.

=== [combat feeling gate] ====

- grounded snow effect:
	- when you change direction or come to a stop, pop up a snow effect? scattered dust into the air.

- weather effect:
	- snow or rain particle effect on screen, at programmable intensity.

- debris effect:
	- when a unit is defeated, create some relevant debris on the ground near them
	ferra leave parts, Friday will leave her coat, etc.

- system to fire projectiles in multiple directions:
	of course we want moves that are able to shoot in every direction.
	in addition to the projectile list, there is a projectile offset list
	- for each entry in the projectile list, it fires a projectile at every position in the offset list.
	- entries in the list range from 0-359 are correspond to a position around the unit relative to the position
	  of the unit circle arrow.

- camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time

- flow mechanic:
	-some moves generate 'flow'
	-some moves can consume 'flow' to change their effect
	just a little something for players to think about when building a combo, that's it.
	-losing flow: if you get hit? if you miss a move?
	-showing flow: something around the player, visually. Like orbs or lines?

- encounter scene expansion:
	a given encounter will be made up of the following:
	- geography: the scene that holds the mat and the obstacles placed on it.
	- army setup: given the geography, this is where all units are placed initially.
	- plot: potential intro and ending cutscene sequences. Kept simple, usually.
	- encounter: rules that dictate how the encounter will play out in terms of combat, like:
		- when to spawn additional enemies/allies (timing, defeated x, etc)
		- unusual victory/defeat conditions (time elapses, ally/boss defeated, etc)
		- scrolling, the route and the speed, if applicable.
		this could end up being complicated, with scrolling, then a room, then more scrolling, etc.
	so create a full encounter scene with all this stuff defined.

- backgrounds and collision (graphical)
	- it would be really cool if objects and background borders had an indicator of where
	  exactly a border is.
	- for example, something like an inobtrusive dotted line around the edges of collision objects.
	bake it into art? seems simplest.
	can then just draw polygons along them.

- red line tracer
	- should we draw a line between mouse position and player to help with aiming?
	- or is it just cool?

- encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-spawning reinforcements, timing, objectives, ending on death/victory.

start of battle animation:
	-if would be cool if there was an animation with all the rings coming on as the fight began. Like a bootup. Like, rapidly increase the ring's scale from 0 to 1 over a time window.

- loadout system swap choice:
	- a simple and elegant way to determine which loadout you're switching to next
	rather than just going through them all in a preset order.
	(for the beginning, we only have 2 loadouts so we can ignore it for now.)
	(mousewhell scroll?)
	(or pressing 1/2/3/4?) <-- fav so far, because it lets you choose any cleanly.
	(or leftclick/rightclick to select either prev or former loadout?)
	the idea is that, although you can't choose a particular move for any situation, you can choose the perfect loadout for the given moment. So it's a bit higher level.
	remember, it is time sensitive as you only have a short window.
	- but to counteract this, you can enter the next loadout at any time to buffer it.

- ai unit targeting indicator:
	- draw a coloured line from them to the circle of their target? or just in that direction? idk.

- alternate attack system, in case this falls apart:
	you have a combo counter from 1...x
	- you equip weapons (attack patterns) where the move differs depending on combo counter
	- you can switch which weapon you are attacking with in the middle of the combo.
	e.g. you can attack snaphammer1 -> snaphammer2 -> rifle3 -> box4 -> rifle5 -> ...
	or any other combination that you want.	
	note: this does feel like an idea where

=== [vn-ready gate] ===

-visuals (to consider)
	-lip sync
	-blinking
	-breath
	-pose changing (like sideview, or back.)
	-small window (for anse's hands, the box, e.g. a necklace, etc)
	-being able to animate while speaking.
	-variable text bubble location, like near the speaker.
	-weather
