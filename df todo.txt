commit notes:
-started geography scene with mat and world border
-redid collision to decouple projectile collision and movement collision


======= TODO: combat feeling

collision layers/masks notes:
	- 1: everything related to units moving and hitting world border or obstacles.
	- 2: everything related to projectiles hitting at units and obstacles.

next steps:
- import mat into scene---------------------------------------------------------[DONE]
- create borders around mat-----------------------------------------------------[DONE]
- decouple movement/projectile collision----------------------------------------[DONE]
- create obstacle object (scene) that	
	- has bullet collision
	- has unit collision
- before going too far, make them pathfinding compatible
	- something simple like ai on one side, a wall, move to other side
	- we will know it works if they can circumnavigate it

- backgrounds and collision (graphical)
	- it would be really cool if objects and background borders had an indicator of where
	  exactly a border is.
	- for example, something like an inobtrusive dotted line around collision objects.

- new visual take
	things to remember for background:
	- should be clear where the border with the out of bounds area is.
	- big flat image map to make the background image. does nothing.
		- is it troublesome to have a massive png in the level? No, almost certainly not.
		- and if it is, then you can always change how things work. 
	- then place obstacles and other important things on the level mat.
		- have a big set of obstacles, so we can use many of them without repeating too much.
	- can also place non-obstacles too, of course. Just visual flavor.
	a single map is only geographic and can be reused across many encounters.
	and in fact, it should be.

- adelie unit visual overhaul
	- update the spritesheet

- system to fire projectiles in multiple directions
	of course we want moves that are able to shoot in every direction.
	in addition to the projectile list, there is a projectile offset list
	- for each entry in the projectile list, it fires a projectile at every position in the offset list.
	- entries in the list range from 0-359 are correspond to a position around the unit relative to the position
	  of the unit circle arrow.

- new movement system to consider and test
	will this really work?
	i think the main issue with it is that:
	- it is possible to adjust to w/s for acceleration/de towards pointer
	- but it is much harder for the side dashes. So change how they work.
	what about something like:
	- double tap in the constant direction? this way you don't have to disorient yourself everytime.
	- you would also have to let go of the de/accelerator before hand though (but i think that's fine)

	another concern is that it will feel troublesome to position yourself for your combos.
	- i think that is true. how can it be fixed, though?
	- maybe on the contrary it means that you should be more careful with positioning?

	ACTUALLY, here's like probably a way better idea:
	- instead of shift being a boost, holding shift would enter into flight mode.
	- when in flight mode, character moves in direction of pointer. faster than normal.
	- probably there would also be a limited duration to it.
	- simple as.
	so you would only want to do this to escape enemies, or close distance fast, or dodge a tricky attack.
	- does it create a situation where you can just shift and run away every time an enemy attacks?
	- maybe, but you still have to get closer yourself too, you know.
	- also, you could still do that in baldr sky, but game still slapped.
	- our method of forcing different weapon sets to be equipped should combat that, right?

	create a branch to test it
	2nd reflection:
	-w/s acceleration towards pointer
	-a/d for short sideways dashes (slows forward/back acceleration too, probably)
	when close to an enemy, your side dashes and small movement should work
	but to reposition yourself, etc, you will need to rely on your movement
	-this system should also be flexible enough to work for flight challenges too
	-fly through with mouth and use boosts to dodge obstacles without losing speed


- melee projectile colliders
	- they should extend all the way from the unit's core to the endpoint. it's not cool to miss the target because they are too close inside your ring.
	
- background collision
	-map scene: main background image and edge borders collision
	-obstacle scene: image (rocks/pillar) and collision
	a background would probably be best created dynamically within the editor, probably.
	-in that case, maybe we should look into tilesets for this?

- map logic
	-units can navigate around obstacles

camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time

- flow mechanic:
	-some moves generate 'flow'
	-some moves can consume 'flow' to change their effect
	just a little something for players to think about when building a combo, that's it.

- encounter design:
	a given encounter will be made up of the following:
	- geography: the scene that holds the mat and the obstacles placed on it.
	- army setup: given the geography, this is where all units are placed initially.
	- plot: potential intro and ending cutscene sequences. Kept simple, usually.
	- encounter: rules that dictate how the encounter will play out in terms of combat, like:
		- when to spawn additional enemies/allies (timing, defeated x, etc)
		- unusual victory/defeat conditions (time elapses, ally/boss defeated, etc)
		- scrolling, the route and the speed, if applicable.
		this could end up being complicated, with scrolling, then a room, then more scrolling, etc.

--- engagement

- red line tracer
	- draw a line between mouse position and player to help with aiming
	- or should we?

- remember to create the combat ai in such a way to allow 3-way battles.

- some stuff is broken with multiple enemies here, btw. I think the issue is that they are not being instantiated separately. It's almost certainly this, but make sure before doing any more.
	-pass to encounter manager and have it instantiate them from there
	should fix any issues

- build loadouts properly:
	-see paper notes for movesets. we'll need 2 for anse.

- basic enemy ai:
	(every second or 1/2 second or so)
	-enemy looks at all player units and decides who to attack based on:
		-proximity preference (melee likes close, ranged likes far, some are flexible)
		-how many other units are targeting it (stored by encounter manager)
	-enemy decides which move to use:
		-could be ranged, could be melee, could decide to simply approach instead
	-when the decision has been reached (target + move):
		-the enemy executes it until completion (hit occurs) or timeout (giving up)
	and repeat

	you can make a basic pattern to enemy attacks like this if you want:
	-2 loadouts, but one loadout just has a 'stop' time waster move. interesting.

- encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-coordination, so they don't all attack the same target
		-spawning reinforcements, etc

start of battle animation:
	-if would be cool if there was an animation with all the rings coming on as the fight began

== vn don't forget



-visuals (to consider)
	-lip sync
	-blinking
	-breath
