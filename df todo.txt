commit notes:
-added player taking damage from projectiles
-added damage number popup from projectiles
-added hp bar update animation

======= TODO:

keep watching that brackeys video, there will probably be a lot of useful and well-presented information

UNIT SCENE
	*add more move spawning patterns for projectiles
	-close limited range move
	-multi bullet move
	-AoE move (in front of you; at mouse location)
	-idk, there are probably some other things we should test too
	(the way you will create more projectile patterns is: create new proj scene)
	(change the collider of the area2d shape to the new shape)
	(change the function that spawns it to move it differently or whatever)
	(tada, should be everything)

ENEMY SCENE
	*for now, can just be a target dummy. make sure you can hit them with the projectile
	next steps would be:
	*have it use pathfinding2d to navigate the map and move straight towards the player
	before getting too far, look at some other top-down games and see how their ai is:
	-like baldr sky, etc
	how does their enemy ai actually behave?

PROJECTILE SCENE
	once you have ally and enemy:
	-two different layers for projectiles (brackeys vid, ~30m)
	-player, allies, and enemy projectiles share a layer
	-enemies and player/ally projectiles share a layer
	-walls are on both layers
	this will let you shoot through your teammates
	we also want to make sure that they don't hit and annihilate each other
	bullets of any type should be able to pass through each other with no problem

MOVE SCENE
	holds information about:
	-stats information for the attack
	-projectile child (and the collision shape will be set for it here)
	-a spawning function that creates projectiles with certain timing

ARENA SCENE
	contains a tilemap with obstacles, etc
	when we actually have our tileset made, watch this again and implement it
	*it has all the tools we want, i know because i saw them there
	(see brackeys video section: worldbuilding)

CAMERA SCENE
	It shouldn't just follow the player blindly
	I was looking at baldr sky gameplay to get an idea of this, and it seems like it
	tries to stay between the player and the target, keeping them both in frame
	Let's try to mimic that

ENCOUNTER SCENE
	has information for
	-victory conditions, etc
	-player, allies, enemies and timings, etc
	-a reference to an ARENA scene. By swapping this out, you change the map

OBSTACLE SCENE
	when you hit a wall you should bounce off it
	*has a vector.reflection thing that can help with this
	oh, also the characterbody2d.bounce() function hehe

REMEMBER
	*on unit defeat, debris
	*heal projectiles (can still work, they should just be like slow-moving floaty bubbles and the idea would be that you have to go run into them. good idea. love ya nai.
