5. around unit ui-------------------------------------------------[]
6. stun mechanic and timing---------------------------------------[]
7. stun expanded (breaking move)----------------------------------[]


- around unit ui:
	ui around a unit consists of:
	- health meter, which depletes
	- stun meter, which fills? Or should it deplete as well? Maybe deplete too.
	or maybe stun meter should actually be a percentage?
	should all these numbers be a percentage displayed instead of meters?

- stun timing problem:
	- units trading damage
	when you hit, it doesn't like actually stop the ai from retaliating it seems
	so we should add that mechanic in.
	in more exact terms:
	- all moves do damage and also stun damage (as a multiplier of damage)
	- when a unit's stun meter is filled, they are stunned.
		- whatever action they were in the middle of immediately ends
		- they remain in that stunned state for a period of time based on
		  the attack that inflicted the final break.

- stun extra mechanics:
	- can we incentivize stun even more? Or make it more interesting?
	what about something like:
	- in addition to your loadouts, a unit has a timer recharge 'breaker' which is the only way to break something.
	  you use this with right click. You can also get different breakers, etc, over the course of the game.
	  basically, it makes it so that you have to recognize when something is ready to be broken, and then do it with
	  intent. Also gives you explicit control over when you want to start your break-combo.
	- dmg multiplier (sure, obvious)
	- no loadout switch delay when you're attacking a broken target? Could be, maybe?

- adelie unit visual overhaul
	- update the spritesheet

- basic enemy ai:
	WE WILL KNOW THIS IS DONE WHEN:
	-anse and an enemy are spawned in
	-the enemy lunges for anse, but he dodges
	-then, anse dives in and hits them, also stunning them and hitting a full combo
	-after the combo, the enemy recovers and preps to hit us again
	-we use that moment to fall back and dodge their next move
	then the whole system basically repeats

- combat feeling:
	- it's not enough to work, it must also feel right.
	we will be able to judge it feels right if we're in a situation where:
	- we have a scene in a pretty encounter map with anse + Friday vs like 4 adelie.
	(of course this is something we aren't just 1 step away from)

- change melee on-ring projectiles:
	- they should be more like arcs or arrows on the ring, covering a larger area along the length of it
	looks cooler and is easier to hit

- system to fire projectiles in multiple directions
	of course we want moves that are able to shoot in every direction.
	in addition to the projectile list, there is a projectile offset list
	- for each entry in the projectile list, it fires a projectile at every position in the offset list.
	- entries in the list range from 0-359 are correspond to a position around the unit relative to the position
	  of the unit circle arrow.

- new movement system to consider and test
	ACTUALLY, here's like probably a way better idea:
	- in normal movement mode, wasd like already implemented.
	- instead of shift being a boost, pressing shift would enter into flight mode.
	- when in flight mode, character moves in direction of pointer. faster than normal.
	- probably there would also be a limited duration to it. and also a lockout period too.
	- simple as.
	so you would only want to do this to escape enemies, or close distance fast, or dodge a tricky attack.
	- does it create a situation where you can just shift and run away every time an enemy attacks?
	- maybe, but you still have to get closer yourself too, you know.
	- also, you could still do that in baldr sky, but game still slapped.
	- our method of forcing different weapon sets to be equipped should combat that, right?

- point of fire problem:
	- if an enemy is too close, you could fire past them. and the player could facehug enemies too.
	this is undesirable, so we need a solution.

- camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time

- flow mechanic:
	-some moves generate 'flow'
	-some moves can consume 'flow' to change their effect
	just a little something for players to think about when building a combo, that's it.

- encounter scene expansion:
	a given encounter will be made up of the following:
	- geography: the scene that holds the mat and the obstacles placed on it.
	- army setup: given the geography, this is where all units are placed initially.
	- plot: potential intro and ending cutscene sequences. Kept simple, usually.
	- encounter: rules that dictate how the encounter will play out in terms of combat, like:
		- when to spawn additional enemies/allies (timing, defeated x, etc)
		- unusual victory/defeat conditions (time elapses, ally/boss defeated, etc)
		- scrolling, the route and the speed, if applicable.
		this could end up being complicated, with scrolling, then a room, then more scrolling, etc.
	so create a full encounter scene with all this stuff defined.

- backgrounds and collision (graphical)
	- it would be really cool if objects and background borders had an indicator of where
	  exactly a border is.
	- for example, something like an inobtrusive dotted line around the edges of collision objects.
	bake it into art? seems simplest.
	can then just draw polygons along them.

- red line tracer
	- should we draw a line between mouse position and player to help with aiming?

- remember to create the combat ai in such a way to allow 3-way battles.

- some stuff is broken with multiple enemies here, btw. I think the issue is that they are not being instantiated separately. It's almost certainly this, but make sure before doing any more.
	-pass to encounter manager and have it instantiate them from there
	should fix any issues

- build loadouts properly:
	-see paper notes for movesets. we'll need 2 for anse.

- encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-coordination, so they don't all attack the same target
		-spawning reinforcements, etc

start of battle animation:
	-if would be cool if there was an animation with all the rings coming on as the fight began

== vn don't forget



-visuals (to consider)
	-lip sync
	-blinking
	-breath
