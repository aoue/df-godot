commit notes:
-added target icon
-added weapon animation and rotation

======= TODO:

finish watching that brackeys video, there will probably be a lot of useful and well-presented information

PLAYER SCENE
	*add use projectile:
	(in attacking mode)
	-takes a projectile scene
	-spawns it and directs it in target icon direction

UNIT SCENE
	the PLAYER, ENEMY, and ALLY scenes will all hold a reference to an object of the UNIT scene
	-this holds and manages stats and stuff, etc
	-also the loadouts and the moves in them

PROJECTILE SCENE
	all projectiles share this, just have different properties. Such as
	(i wrote some of this out already, so see notes)
	-collision area/shape
	-speed modifier
	-acceleration
	-dmg (and types)

CAMERA SCENE
	(if the camera is a child of the player it will follow the player)
	how should the camera work? It shouldn't just follow the player blindly
	I was looking at baldr sky gameplay to get an idea of this, and it seems like it
	tries to stay between the player and the target, keeping them both in frame
	it adjusts position and zoom to do this?

ENCOUNTER SCENE
	has information for
	-victory conditions, etc
	-player, allies, enemies and timings, etc
	-a reference to an ARENA scene. By swapping this out, you change the map

ARENA SCENE
	contains a tilemap with obstacles, etc
	when we actually have our tileset made, watch this again and implement it
	*it has all the tools we want, i know because i saw them there
	(see brackeys video section: worldbuilding)

REMEMBER
	-on unit defeat, debris
