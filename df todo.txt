commit notes:
-updated animation visuals to communicate backup slowdown
-finished summon move speed slowdowns only imposed once firing starts
-passthrough projectiles cannot hit the same target more than once
-added recoil parameter to moves, of both on hit and on fire types

======= TODO: combat feeling

- visuals:
	-summon move 'launch animation' when projectile is fired

- create the loadout class
	-a loadout has 3 moves attached to it in order
	-you may select the equipped move with (1,2,3); (start with 1)
	-successive left clicks fire the next move in the sequence
	-a move, once used, cannot be used again (refresh function will unlock them all)
	test:
	-make sure that anse can go through the loadout and use each of the 3 moves one time

- background visuals
	-draw a background image
	-draw rocks/pillars
	
- background collision
	-map scene: main background image and edge borders collision
	-obstacle scene: iamge (rocks/pillar) and collision
	a background would probably be best created dynamically within the editor, probably.
	-in that case, maybe we should look into tilesets for this?

- map logic
	-units can navigate around obstacles

- stunning (visual): when a unit is stunned
	-display the stun meter above their head showing how much time is left on it

- attacking (visual): when a unit is attacking
	-show the attacking duration meter above their head to show how much time is left

- create a UI mockup. We need to somehow show:
	-player health
	-currently equipped moves and their status, near the player icon?
	-next move to use very near to the player
	-enemy health
	-text and stuff around units on screen.
	Show:
	-speed
	-move they're using
	-hp
	-stun duration
	basically, a bunch of text to make it look more high tech. Super cool.

camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time


--- engagement

- some stuff is broken with multiple enemies here, btw. I think the issue is that they are not being instantiated separately. It's almost certainly this, but make sure before doing any more.
	-pass to encounter manager and have it instantiate them from there
	should fix any issues

- second loadout:
	-anse needs a second loadout for the combat to really work
	-his first loadout should be gun moves
	-his second loadout should be snaphammer moves
	(see paper notes, already planned this out, i think.)

- basic enemy ai:
	(every second or 1/2 second or so)
	-enemy looks at all player units and decides who to attack based on:
		-proximity preference (melee likes close, ranged likes far, some are flexible)
		-how many other units are targeting it (stored by encounter manager)
	-enemy decides which move to use:
		-could be ranged, could be melee, could decide to simply approach instead
	-when the decision has been reached (target + move):
		-the enemy executes it until completion (hit occurs) or timeout (giving up)
	and repeat

- encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-coordination, so they don't all attack the same target
		-spawning reinforcements, etc

start of battle animation:
	-if would be cool if there was an animation with all the rings coming on as the fight began

== vn don't forget



-visuals (to consider)
	-lip sync
	-blinking
	-breath
