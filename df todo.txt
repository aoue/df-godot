immediate notes:
-

- balancing stuff:
	- create a branch and delete a bunch of stuff to go into this clean.
	well, some things feel a bit off.
	doesn't play very technical.
	main concerns:
	- combat feels light and attacks don't hit hard.
	- you don't feel the meaning or weight of landing an attack or being hit.
	- getting hit once often leads to getting dogpiled.
	
	ideas to change this:
	1) simple HP and damage calcs, so every hit can be clearly understood. Like, single digit hp and damage hits.
	2) more committed attacks, while still being responsive. Using the right move rewards you, but using the wrong move or failing during execution will see you punished. 
	a) attacks have more movement, have longer duration, smaller turn window, more bullets fired. This creates the commitment and impact we're looking for. Once a unit begins the action, they're locked in for longer leaving an opening to be hit during.
	b) reduce the half arc projectile to a quarter arc, a half arc is just too big.
	3) more downtime after actions, so you are committed to the mistake. so increase time between when the last projectile is fired/last hitbox fades away and when the move has released its hold on you.
	4) increase knockback of some moves to add rhythm to combat and protect you from being dogpiled.
	
	work on these in a small scale, 1-on-1 situation. Then scale them up and see.
	remember:
	- each move should feel significant.
	- play should feel technical.
	- enemies should feel like they have clear openings.
		(ex1: adelie dive attack: start, move in line, recover standing still for a moment; lock movement while recovering. uses standing.)
		(ex2: unit fires projectiles in line, slowly banking but not enough. We move around it and it finishes; lock movement while recovering. then we hit in that window.)
	maybe i need to carefully study the behaviour of a baldr sky enemy.


- art notes:
	- consider increasing sprite size to like 1200x or 1500x to allow for more detailed drawings. Also leads to better horror too.
	- and place emphasis on backpacks/engines and hip jets.
	- named characters have hair poking through and unique designs.

- Friday unit:
	- object
	- spritesheet
	- moveset

- ai dodging:
	- more advanced units (allies or enemies) need to be able to dodge at least a little
	could start with something as simple as:
	- wherever it is you want to be, if you feel you are under threat
		- you want distance but enemy close, or you want close but enemy distant (but not too distant)
		- and you are not too close already to target position
	- if you can, then use your boost in the direction you want to go
	this will naturally help units either close distance or make distance.
	remember, boost is already implemented in unit body, so just have to do flags.

- ai delay between actions as range:
	for some enemies, to make them more unpredictable:
	- delay between actions can become a range and stuff.
	
- combat feeling review:
	- it's not enough to just work, it must also feel right.
	we will be able to judge it feels right if we're in a situation where:
	- we have a scene in a pretty encounter map with anse + Friday vs like 4 adelie.
	- also test a scene against a more boss-like enemy. Faster to react, does combos, etc
	do these feel good?
	
	important things:
	- does it feel slick? like you know what's happening? what's going on?
	- moves should have weight behind them. it should feel like: Bang! to bang! to bang!
	each thing you do, you're doing on purpose, and the game clearly reacts to you doing it.

sound overhaul:

================

- art overhaul:
	- the spritesheet for anse will need to be redone at some point. Probably by adding his hair and changing colours to the brown/tan of his coat.
		- maybe could do something like tall lined collar but no hood; go back to big collared anse. symbolic, etc, after all.
	Here's a general idea. For generic FSes, they can wear full hoods.
	But for important characters, they should have their hair visible somewhere.

- if there is some kind of special move:
	it would be to skip the loadout timer swap and immediately go to the next one.
	- break accumulates on units normally, when a unit is broken, though:
	- no loadout skip on switch

- grounded snow effect:
	- when you change direction or come to a stop, pop us a snow effect?

- weather effect:
	- snow or rain particle effects on screen, at varying intensity.

- debris effect:
	- when a unit is defeated, create some relevant debris on the ground near them
	ferra leave parts, Friday will leave her coat, etc.

- system to fire projectiles in multiple directions
	of course we want moves that are able to shoot in every direction.
	in addition to the projectile list, there is a projectile offset list
	- for each entry in the projectile list, it fires a projectile at every position in the offset list.
	- entries in the list range from 0-359 are correspond to a position around the unit relative to the position
	  of the unit circle arrow.

- new movement system to consider and test
	ACTUALLY, here's like probably a way better idea:
	- in normal movement mode, wasd like already implemented.
	- instead of shift being a boost, pressing shift would enter into flight mode.
	- when in flight mode, character moves in direction of pointer. faster than normal.
	- probably there would also be a limited duration to it. and also a lockout period too.
	- simple as.
	so you would only want to do this to escape enemies, or close distance fast, or dodge a tricky attack.
	- does it create a situation where you can just shift and run away every time an enemy attacks?
	- maybe, but you still have to get closer yourself too, you know.
	- also, you could still do that in baldr sky, but game still slapped.
	- our method of forcing different weapon sets to be equipped should combat that, right?

- camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time

- create proper loadouts:
	- see paper notes about this

- flow mechanic:
	-some moves generate 'flow'
	-some moves can consume 'flow' to change their effect
	just a little something for players to think about when building a combo, that's it.
	-losing flow: if you get hit? if you miss a move?
	-showing flow: something around the player, visually. Like orbs or lines?

- encounter scene expansion:
	a given encounter will be made up of the following:
	- geography: the scene that holds the mat and the obstacles placed on it.
	- army setup: given the geography, this is where all units are placed initially.
	- plot: potential intro and ending cutscene sequences. Kept simple, usually.
	- encounter: rules that dictate how the encounter will play out in terms of combat, like:
		- when to spawn additional enemies/allies (timing, defeated x, etc)
		- unusual victory/defeat conditions (time elapses, ally/boss defeated, etc)
		- scrolling, the route and the speed, if applicable.
		this could end up being complicated, with scrolling, then a room, then more scrolling, etc.
	so create a full encounter scene with all this stuff defined.

- backgrounds and collision (graphical)
	- it would be really cool if objects and background borders had an indicator of where
	  exactly a border is.
	- for example, something like an inobtrusive dotted line around the edges of collision objects.
	bake it into art? seems simplest.
	can then just draw polygons along them.

- red line tracer
	- should we draw a line between mouse position and player to help with aiming?

- fill loadouts properly:
	-see paper notes for movesets for prologue units.

- encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-spawning reinforcements, timing, objectives, ending on death/victory.

start of battle animation:
	-if would be cool if there was an animation with all the rings coming on as the fight began. Like a bootup. Like, rapidly increase the ring's scale from 0 to 1 over a time window.

- loadout system:
	- a simple and elegant way to determine which loadout you're switching to next
	rather than just going through them all in a preset order.
	(for the beginning, we only have 2 loadouts so we can ignore it for now.)
	(mousewhell scroll?)
	(or pressing 1/2/3/4?) <-- fav so far, because it lets you choose any cleanly.
	(or leftclick/rightclick to select either prev or former loadout?)
	the idea is that, although you can't choose a particular move for any situation, you can choose the perfect loadout for the given moment. So it's a bit higher level.

== vn don't forget

-visuals (to consider)
	-lip sync
	-blinking
	-breath
	-pose changing (like sideview, or back.)
	-small window (for anse's hands, the box, e.g. a necklace, etc)
	-being able to animate while speaking.
	-variable text bubble location, like near the speaker.
	-weather
