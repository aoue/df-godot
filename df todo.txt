======= TODO: combat feeling

- redraw adelie penguin
	-just a two frame still animation
	-a 'being hit' animation

- create adelie penguin target that can be hit by projectiles
	-no need to worry about hp or anything like that just yet
	-simply switch it to 'being hit' animation is enough

- draw anse unit sprites
	- melee
	- ranged
	- special

- create one attack of each type:
	-immediate release from the ring in the cursor direction
	-placement on the ring in the cursor direction without firing
	-placement on the ring followed by firing on the next click
	the attacks use the generic projectile class to hit the target dummy

- the unit must be able to use the moves and hit the target dummy

- create a UI mockup. We need to somehow show:
	-player health
	-currently equipped moves and their status
	-enemy health
	
zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
