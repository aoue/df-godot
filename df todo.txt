commit notes:
-loadout switch gate added
-added utility bar to help indicate the unit's state and how long remains in it
-loadout switch happens automatically now; forced gate (maybe this mechanic will go?)
-added prototype of stat labels
-had a bluescreen that messed projectile spawning up somehow, implemented projectile mother to avoid the issue forever (also updated drivers)

======= TODO: combat feeling

- background visuals
	-draw a background image
	-draw rocks/pillars
	
- background collision
	-map scene: main background image and edge borders collision
	-obstacle scene: iamge (rocks/pillar) and collision
	a background would probably be best created dynamically within the editor, probably.
	-in that case, maybe we should look into tilesets for this?

- map logic
	-units can navigate around obstacles

camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time

- flow mechanic:
	-some moves generate 'flow'
	-some moves can consume 'flow' to increase their damage
	just a little something for players to think about when building a combo, that's it.

--- engagement

- remember to create the combat ai in such a way to allow 3-way battles.

- some stuff is broken with multiple enemies here, btw. I think the issue is that they are not being instantiated separately. It's almost certainly this, but make sure before doing any more.
	-pass to encounter manager and have it instantiate them from there
	should fix any issues

- build loadouts properly:
	-see paper notes for movesets. we'll need 2 for anse.

- basic enemy ai:
	(every second or 1/2 second or so)
	-enemy looks at all player units and decides who to attack based on:
		-proximity preference (melee likes close, ranged likes far, some are flexible)
		-how many other units are targeting it (stored by encounter manager)
	-enemy decides which move to use:
		-could be ranged, could be melee, could decide to simply approach instead
	-when the decision has been reached (target + move):
		-the enemy executes it until completion (hit occurs) or timeout (giving up)
	and repeat

	you can make a basic pattern to enemy attacks like this if you want:
	-2 loadouts, but one loadout just has a 'stop' time waster move. interesting.

- encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-coordination, so they don't all attack the same target
		-spawning reinforcements, etc

start of battle animation:
	-if would be cool if there was an animation with all the rings coming on as the fight began

== vn don't forget



-visuals (to consider)
	-lip sync
	-blinking
	-breath
