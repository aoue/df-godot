commit notes:
-finished anse and adelie spritesheet assets
-imported new spritesheets and setup

======= TODO: combat feeling

- create a move class
	-the move class will store all the data of the current projectile.
	-all future projectiles will also be made using this

- create one attack of each type:
	-(ranged) immediate release from the ring in the cursor direction
	-(melee) placement on the ring in the cursor direction without firing
	-(summon) placement on the ring followed by firing on the next click
	-you can test test them by changing which projectile anse has equipped
	have them use different projectile shapes and sizes each
	for the effect areas, i'm fine with just showing coloured shapes, just as is.

- ensure that:
	-anse can use each of the three different moves
	-the moves appear on the ring for a moment before being sent outwards

- background visuals
	-need a background image
	-need rocks/pillars

- background collision
	-objects block movement and projectiles from passing
	-edges to the map
	-rocks/pillars (obstacles)

- map logic
	-units can navigate around obstacles

- stunning (visual): when a unit is stunned
	-display the stun meter above their head showing how much time is left on it

- create a UI mockup. We need to somehow show:
	-player health
	-currently equipped moves and their status, near the player icon?
	-next move to use very near to the player
	-enemy health

camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time

--- active enemies



basic enemy ai:
	(every second or 1/2 second or so)
	-enemy looks at all player units and decides who to attack based on:
		-proximity preference (melee likes close, ranged likes far, some are flexible)
		-how many other units are targeting it (stored by encounter manager)
	-enemy decides which move to use:
		-could be ranged, could be melee, could decide to simply approach instead
	-when the decision has been reached (target + move):
		-the enemy executes it until completion (hit occurs) or timeout (giving up)
	and repeat

encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-coordination, so they don't all attack the same target
		-spawning reinforcements, etc
