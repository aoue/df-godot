======= TODO: combat feeling

- draw anse unit sprite animations
	- melee (swinging hammer overhead)
	- ranged (leveling rifle)
	- special (holding box out)
	- being hit (a bit crumpled, 2 frames)

- create one attack of each type:
	-(ranged) immediate release from the ring in the cursor direction
	-(melee) placement on the ring in the cursor direction without firing
	-(summon) placement on the ring followed by firing on the next click
	have them use different projectile shapes and sizes each

- ensure that:
	-anse can use each of the three different moves
	-the moves appear on the ring for a moment before being sent outwards

- stunning (visual): when a unit is stunned
	-display the stun meter above their head showing how much time is left on it

- create a UI mockup. We need to somehow show:
	-player health
	-currently equipped moves and their status, near the player icon?
	-next move to use very near to the player
	-enemy health

camera manager:
	-zoom and move camera so that it can capture everything we want in frame at the same time
	-always the player, and it will expand to try to fit the last _ units you have hit within _ time

-- active enemies

basic enemy ai:
	(every second or 1/2 second or so)
	-enemy looks at all player units and decides who to attack based on:
		-proximity preference (melee likes close, ranged likes far, some are flexible)
		-how many other units are targeting it (stored by encounter manager)
	-enemy decides which move to use:
		-could be ranged, could be melee, could decide to simply approach instead
	-when the decision has been reached (target + move):
		-the enemy executes it until completion (hit occurs) or timeout (giving up)
	and repeat
		

encounter ai:
	-there is an encounter manager which helps with:
		-coordination, so they don't all attack the same target
		-spawning reinforcements, etc
