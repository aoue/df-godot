When introduction a new system, draw at least some passable placeholder art for it.
(This includes colouring)
This will help you stay in love and avoid becoming overwhelmed with a backlog later.

== sprite breakdown ==
in the combat scene, a unit has the following sprites:
0_side_rest: 2 frames
1_side_mov: 3 frames
2_front_rest: 2 frames
3_front_rest: 3 frames
4_back_rest: 2 frames
5_back_move: 3 frames
6_melee: 4 frames
6b_melee_finisher: 1 frame
7_ranged: 4 frames
8_special: 4 frames
9_being_hit: 2 frames
9b_defeated: 1 frame


remember, the attack's effect will distinguish it from other ones, so it's okay to use the same unit animation, depending on type. The animation will just show the character drawing and holding the weapon.
E.g. 
anse: melee will always just show the snaphammer, ranged the submachine gun, special the box.
Friday: melee also uses snaphammer, ranged also uses smg, special will be her forms.
the special is the unit's  unique stuff.
