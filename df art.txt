*Art Policy
When introduction a new system, draw at least some passable placeholder art for it.
(This includes colouring)
This will help you stay in love and avoid becoming overwhelmed with a backlog later.

spritesheets are 4500x5400, with 6 rows and 5 columns
making each sprite slot 900x900

== sprite breakdown ==
in the combat scene, a unit has the following sprites:
0_side_rest: 2 frames
1_side_mov: 3 frames

2_front_rest: 2 frames
3_front_rest: 3 frames

4_back_rest: 2 frames
5_back_move: 3 frames

6_melee: 3 frames
6b_melee_finisher: 1 frame
7_ranged: 3 frames
8_special: 3 frames

9_being_hit: 2 frames
9b_defeated: 1 frame
total: 28 frames

potential more:
10a_emote_happy
10b_emote_sad

remember, the attack's effect will distinguish it from other ones, so it's okay to use the same unit animation, depending on type. The animation will just show the character drawing and holding the weapon.
E.g. 
anse: melee will always just show the snaphammer, ranged the submachine gun, special the box.
Friday: melee also uses snaphammer, ranged also uses smg, special will be her forms.
the special is the unit's  unique stuff.
