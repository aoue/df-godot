*Art Policy
When introduction a new system, draw at least some passable placeholder art for it.
(This includes colouring)
This will help you stay in love and avoid becoming overwhelmed with a backlog later.

spritesheets are 4500x4500 by default
we will go with 5x5, each sprite slot being 900x900


== sprite breakdown ==
in the combat scene, a unit has the following sprites:
left: at rest, moving1, moving2, moving3, moving4 	(5)
right: (reflected from left)
up: rest, moving1, moving2, moving3, moving4 		(10)
down: rest, moving1, moving2, moving3, moving4		(15)
melee: melee1, melee2, melee3				(18)
ranged: ranged1, ranged2, ranged3			(21)
special: special1, special2, special3			(24)

remember, the attack's effect will distinguish it from other ones, so it's okay to use the same unit animation, depending on type. The animation will just show the character drawing and holding the weapon.
E.g. 
anse: melee will always just show the snaphammer, ranged the submachine gun, special the box.
Friday: melee also uses snaphammer, ranged also uses smg, special will be her forms.
the special is the unit's  unique stuff.
