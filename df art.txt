*Art Policy
When introduction a new system, draw at least some passable placeholder art for it.
(This includes colouring)
This will help you stay in love and avoid becoming overwhelmed with a backlog later.

spritesheets are 4500x5400, with 6 rows and 5 columns
making each sprite slot 900x900

== sprite breakdown ==
in the combat scene, a unit has the following sprites:
0_side_rest: 2 sprites, 1 FPS
1_side_mov: 2 /3 sprites, 4 FPS

2_front_rest: 2 sprites, 1 FPS
3_front_rest: 2/3 sprites, 4 FPS

4_back_rest: 2 sprites, 1 FPS
5_back_move: 2/3 sprites, 4 FPS

6_melee: 2 sprites, 2 FPS
6b_melee_finisher: 1 sprites, 1 FPS, does not loop
7_ranged: 2 sprites, 2 FPS
8_special: 2 sprites, 2 FPS

9_being_hit: 2 frames, 2 FPS, does not loop
9b_defeated: 1 frame, 1 FPS, does not loop
total: 28 frames

potential more:
10a_emote1
10b_emote2

remember, the attack's effect will distinguish it from other ones, so it's okay to use the same unit animation, depending on type. The animation will just show the character drawing and holding the weapon.
